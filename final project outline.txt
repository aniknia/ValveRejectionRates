final project outline

priors:
gamma distribution for valve failure
 - scale parameter
	normally distributed?
 - shape parameter
	normally distributed?
vendor
 - normally distributed, with a tight spread (look up typical vendor valve stats, if available)

set pressure
- assume higher set pressure --> more likely to fail

service medium
- unsure distribution

multiple things need to add/multiply together to get a failure rate
 - if these are independent, can the probabilities just be multiplied? i.e. vendor is independent from set pressure & service medium
